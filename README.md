# cansat-kernel-v2
RTOS kernel for YKTSAT-1 CubeSat FCU
## Building
Toolchain: GNU C99 (AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1778) version 5.4.0 (avr)

These makefiles use Atmel Studio 7 pre-packaged compiler, you need to set up path to your own avr-gcc compiler.

`Make-boot: Makefile for bootloader`

`Make-rtos: Makefile for the kernel`

Each example has its own Makefile, too.
